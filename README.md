# Factorial and Fibonacci Sequence Calculator
**Elizabeth Omari Eb3/61532/22**
## Description
This project contains two programs:
1. A program to calculate the **factorial** of a given number.
2. A program to compute the **Fibonacci sequence** for a given number.

Each program also calculates the **runtime** of the respective calculations.

## Technologies Used
- C++ 
- `chrono` library for measuring execution time
-VsCode
## Example usage
**Factorial**
Enter a number to calculate factorial: 13
Factorial of 13 is: 6227020800
Time taken: 0 microseconds

Enter a number to calculate factorial: 5
Factorial of 5 is: 120
Time taken (high_resolution_clock): 0 microseconds

**Fibonacci sequence**
Enter a number to calculate Fibonacci: 13
Fibonacci(13) is: 233
Time taken: 3 microseconds

Enter a number to calculate Fibonacci: 39
Fibonacci(39) is: 63245986
Time taken: 443373 microseconds
